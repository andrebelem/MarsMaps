# 🔗 Highly Resourceful Links for Image and Data Retrieval 🌌

In this section, you’ll find links to resources where a wealth of images and datasets can be accessed. These are essential tools for planetary mapping and data analysis, especially for Mars and Europa research. Please explore each link to discover the available imagery, geologic maps, and scientific data.

- **[🌑 Mars Express HRSC Data Node](https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mars_express/hrsc.htm)**  
  Access map-projected image data (V4) covering dates from January 1 to April 23, 2023. See orbit 3155 [here](https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/mex/mex-m-hrsc-4-refdr-mapproject-ext1-v4/mexhrs_6001/data/3155/) for images with a ground resolution of approximately 16 m/pixel over the Noctis Labyrinthus region. For an example of data usage, see [this notebook](https://github.com/MITHaystack/scikit-dataaccess/blob/master/skdaccess/examples/Demo_ODE.ipynb).

- **[🛰️ Coordinate Systems for Planetary Mapping](https://sbn.psi.edu/mc-f2f/2017/presentations/Europa%20Clipper%20Coordinate%20System%20Convention%2020170803.pdf)**  
  This document (2017) is an in-depth look at coordinate systems used for mapping the Galilean satellites, including Europa. It discusses the shift from a west-positive longitude planetographic system to an east-positive longitude planetocentric system, with explanations on differences, historical context, and rationale.

- **[📜 SIM 3513 Sheet: Global Geologic Map of Europa](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3513/sim3513_sheet.pdf)**  
  This publication provides a detailed geologic map of Europa’s surface, illustrating terrain types and geological features. Created by Erin J. Leonard, D. Alex Patthoff, and David A. Senske (2024), it’s an invaluable tool for planetary science studies.

- **[🗺️ Global Geologic Map of Europa - Publication](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sim3513)**  


- **🌄 Noctis Labyrinthus, Mars**  
  The European Space Agency provides [information and images](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Noctis_Labyrinthus_labyrinth_of_the_night) of the Noctis Labyrinthus region, also known as Mars’ "labyrinth of the night," captured by the High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on Mars Express. Basic background is available on [USGS](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/4324).

- **[🗺️ Planetary GIS Downloads from USGS](https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/GIS_Downloads)**  
  Access GIS-ready files and resources for planetary mapping, useful for integrating planetary data into GIS software for advanced analysis.

- **[🔭 Mars Express Science Node](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/psa/mars-express)**  
  This is a primary hub for Mars Express science data. Here you can find additional datasets, images, and mission information useful for a wide range of Mars-related studies.
