This is a repository for the notebook/tutorial I created for the European Geophysical Union course EGU22 SC5.2 Crafting beautiful maps with PyGMT, in cooperation with a group formed by Wei Ji Leong, Leonardo Uieda, Meghan Jones (see https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/egu22pygmt).

Some other experiments, other bonus maps and more tutorials geared towards some planets and moons in our solar system will be here.

History:<br>
June 2022: Now you have access to the 'mola32.nc' file in the repo.
