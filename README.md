This is a repository for the notebook/tutorial I created for the European Geophysical Union course EGU22 SC5.2 Crafting beautiful maps with [**PyGMT**](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt), in cooperation with a group formed by [Wei Ji Leong](https://github.com/weiji14), [Leonardo Uieda](https://github.com/leouieda), [Meghan Jones](https://github.com/meghanrjones) (see https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/egu22pygmt).

Some other experiments, bonus maps and more tutorials geared towards some planets and moons in our solar system will be here soon.

History:<br>
June 2022: Now you have access to the 'mola32.nc' file in the repo, *Valles Marineris* 3D map and Jezero Crater map.<br>
