# MarsMaps

This is a (preparatory) repository for the notebook/tutorial I created for the European Geophysical Union course EGU22 SC5.2 Crafting beautiful maps with PyGMT, in cooperation with a group formed by Wei Ji Leong, Leonardo Uieda, Meghan Jones (see https ://github.com/GenericMappingTools/egu22pygmt).

Some other experiments, other bonus maps and more tutorials geared towards Mars will be here.
